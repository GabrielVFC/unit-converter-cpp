# Unit Converter (C++) 🔢

A comprehensive C++ command-line tool designed to handle complex conversions between different numeral systems. This project demonstrates core programming logic and efficient data handling in a low-level language.

### 🚀 Key Features

The application is divided into five specialized modules, each managing distinct conversion paths:

* **Decimal Engine**: Converts Decimal values to Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal.
* **Reverse Logic Engine**: Converts Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal inputs back into Decimal.
* **Binary Specialist**: Handles direct conversions from Binary to Decimal, Octal, and Hexadecimal.
* **Octal Specialist**: Manages conversions from Octal to Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal.
* **Hexadecimal Specialist**: Executes conversions from Hexadecimal to Decimal, Binary, and Octal.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Paradigm:** Procedural Programming
- **Interface:** Command Line Interface (CLI)
